# My implementation of Easy21 (WIP)

My implementation of the Easy21 programming exercise using Reinforcement Learning, from David Silver's excellent 2015 Reinforcement Learning course. 

Instructions:
1. Run `pip install .` in the same directory as the `setup.py` file. 

See the `demo_environment.ipynb` for sample usage. Note that this environment was built
and tested with Python 3.10 and numpy. 

`MonteCarloControl.ipynb` demos what happens when Monte Carlo Control is run. `TD_Learning.ipynb` is the equivalent for TD learning
